</p><p style="margin-top:40px">Documents and downloadable media are made available <br>to the network through web servers and can be accessed <br>by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources <br>on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). <br>The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). <br>This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. <br>The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) <br>which provide immediate access to other web resources. <br>Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. <br>Web applications are web pages that function as application software. <br>The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p></body>
